# 1942-Game-HT-LEB

This is the repository for the first level of the game 1942 that we will be making for our programming class.

## Sprites:

We will start by making all the sprites we need and attaching them to one folder and uplodading that folder to the repository.

## Skeleton Code:

We will make a template of all the classes we will need and start working on them.

## Main:

We will write a main file that contains all the code to execute our game.

## Troubleshooting && Testing:

We will troubleshoot any errors we get and test our code to make sure that it works as it is supposed to work, constantly refining it until it fits within
the guidelines laid out to us by the document.

## Notes:

- Must use setter and getters.
- Most code must be inside the classes.
- Doc string comments for each class and method/function.
- Optional adding of music which we will do depending on if we feel like it and have time.
